            <p class="main-p">The 9/11 Television News Archive is a library of news coverage of the events of 9/11/2001 and their aftermath as presented by U.S. and international broadcasters. A resource for scholars, journalists, and the public, it presents one week of news broadcasts for study, research and analysis.</p>
            <p class="main-p">Television is our pre-eminent medium of information, entertainment and persuasion, but until now it has not been a medium of record. This Archive attempts to address this gap by making TV news coverage of this critical week in September 2001 available to those studying these events and their treatment in the media.</p>
            <p class="main-p"><a href="https://archive.org/details/911/day/20010911">Explore</a> 3,000 hours of international TV News from 20 channels over 7 days, and select analysis by scholars.</p></p>
